# component-oauth-card

OAuth card component for Greentic `component@0.6.0`.

This component shows OAuth status, sign-in, and blocking messages for a flow. It
does not import the OAuth broker directly. Instead, your flow calls the
Greentic OAuth operations from `../greentic-oauth` first, then passes their
results into this component.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.91+
- `wasm32-wasip2` target (`rustup target add wasm32-wasip2`)

This repository follows the self-describing 0.6.0 shape instead of legacy
`flows/default.ygtc` and `flows/custom.ygtc`.

## Required Greentic OAuth Extension

This component cannot work on its own.

It requires the Greentic OAuth provider extension and operations from
`../greentic-oauth` to be installed in the environment where the flow runs.
That extension is what:

- knows which OAuth providers exist
- stores and refreshes OAuth credentials
- returns consent URLs
- exchanges authorization codes for tokens

If the Greentic OAuth provider extension is missing, or if `provider_id` does
not match a provider that extension exposes, the upstream OAuth operations
cannot produce the data this component needs and the flow stays blocked.

## What This Component Does

- Shows a connected or needs-sign-in card for a chosen OAuth provider.
- Returns an authorization header only when a usable token is available.
- Marks the response as `can_continue: false` when authentication is still required.
- Exposes setup questions so Greentic can configure it without custom flow files.
- Exposes i18n-aware self-description data through `component-info`.

## Main Operations

- `oauth_card.handle_message`
- `component-info`
- `qa-spec`
- `apply-answers`
- `i18n-keys`

## Typical Flow

1. Make sure the Greentic OAuth provider extension is installed and that your chosen provider ID exists there.
2. Configure the component once with a default provider ID and optional scopes.
3. Call a Greentic OAuth operation to check for a usable token.
4. Call `oauth_card.handle_message` with `mode: "status-card"` or `mode: "ensure-token"` and pass that token as `current_token`.
5. If the component says `needs-sign-in`, call a Greentic OAuth operation that returns a consent URL.
6. Call the component with `mode: "start-sign-in"` and pass that URL as `consent_url`.
7. After your callback endpoint receives an auth code, call a Greentic OAuth operation that exchanges the code.
8. Call the component with `mode: "complete-sign-in"` and pass the returned token as `exchanged_token`.
9. Only continue the flow when the response has `can_continue: true`.

## Authentication Rules

The intended behavior is:

1. You configure which OAuth service/provider this component is for.
2. That provider must exist in the installed Greentic OAuth provider extension.
3. A separate Greentic OAuth operation checks for a usable token for that provider, user, and scope.
4. That OAuth operation may use a stored refresh token to refresh the access token and persist the updated token set.
5. If no usable token exists, or reauthentication is needed, this component returns `needs-sign-in` and `can_continue: false`.
6. The flow should not continue until the user completes sign-in successfully.
7. The user may retry, but no downstream authenticated step should proceed until `can_continue: true`.

## Runtime Input Fields

`oauth_card.handle_message` expects the usual `mode`, `provider_id`, and
`subject`, plus upstream OAuth operation results when relevant:

- `current_token`: token already checked or refreshed upstream
- `consent_url`: URL that starts the sign-in step
- `exchanged_token`: token returned after exchanging an authorization code
- `oauth_error`: upstream OAuth error to show to the user

## Configuration

The component stores a small runtime configuration:

- `provider_id`: the OAuth provider name, such as `msgraph` or `github`; this must be exposed by the installed Greentic OAuth provider extension
- `default_subject`: optional fallback user identifier
- `scopes`: default scopes to request
- `tenant`: optional tenant context
- `team`: optional team context
- `redirect_path`: optional callback path override
- `allow_auto_sign_in`: whether `ensure-token` should create a sign-in card automatically

Greentic can build this configuration automatically through:

- `qa-spec`: asks the setup/update/remove questions
- `apply-answers`: converts those answers into saved config JSON

## i18n

English source strings live in `assets/i18n/en.json`. `build.rs` embeds every
locale JSON file under `assets/i18n/` into the final wasm at build time.
The same build step also renders `component.manifest.json` from
`component.manifest.template.json`, so the manifest version tracks
`Cargo.toml` automatically.

Use `./tools/i18n.sh` to generate or refresh translated locale files.

## Output Contract

The main runtime output includes:

- `status`: `ok`, `needs-sign-in`, or `error`
- `can_continue`: whether the flow is allowed to proceed
- `card`: what to show the user
- `auth_header`: only present when a usable token is available
- `auth_context`: token/provider context for downstream logic

If `can_continue` is `false`, treat that as a hard stop for the current flow
path until the user finishes authentication successfully.

## Development Checks

```bash
cargo test
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

For a component artifact, manifest hash, and doctor validation:

```bash
make wasm
make doctor
```
